<style>
body {
	font-family: "Times New Roman"; 
	margin-left:20%;
	margin-right:20%;
	text-align:justify;
	background:ivory; 
	color:red;
}

p {
	textindent:2cm;
} 

h1,h2,h3 { 
	color:red; 
	margin-left:2cm; 
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>
The font family wasn't in complete "" and not capitalized correctly <br>
The spacing overall was wacky <br>
For h1, h2 and h3 the margin-left was missing '-' and also missing a semi-colon<br>
The paragraph text indent has a '-'
