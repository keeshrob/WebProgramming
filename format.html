Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find out that HTML gives them little control over the way that a page is displayed. <br> It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation. <p>Formatting tech to appear on a web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear </p> in a printed document.
